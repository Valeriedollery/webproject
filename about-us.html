	<br>
	<br>

<blockquote><div class="b"> Mick Ryan started this business in 1983
at the age of 17, he had started an apprenticeship with a local man and was thumbing
around 14 miles to work daily. He eventually bought the shell of a 1967 Ford Anglia
with no engine, gear box or axel, and a crashed Ford Cortina. He then transferred all
the good parts from the Cortina to the Anglia in the evenings after work.<br>
He got the car running again and his Grandfather gifted him a rundown workshop. 
He then started to turn this place into an area for doing services and repairs 
in his spare time. He eventually finished his apprenticeship and had enough hard 
work done to open his garage and start his business.. Mick started up his 
	long-term business of 40 years <em><strong>“Mick’s Motors”</strong></em></div></blockquote><br>
